PROMPT 2
now make a python program to iterate through all the data in this json data
and make a instance like this
new_reply = Subcomment(
        body = json data via iteration,
        upvote =  json data via iteration,
        downvote =  json data via iteration,
        user_id = json data via iteration ,
        comment_id = json data via iteration,
        date =  json data via iteration,
        anonymous =  json data via iteration,
        color =  json data via iteration ,
        intensity =  json data via iteration)
